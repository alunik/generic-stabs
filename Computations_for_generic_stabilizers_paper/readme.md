## Specific computations

This folder contains the code that was used to handle two specific cases from my paper titled "Generic stabilizers for simple algebraic groups acting on orthogonal and symplectic Grassmannians".

It is split into various listings, each dealing with some specific question.

- Listing 1: Double covers of Sym(6) and Alt(7).
- Listing 2: The case $2.2^4.Sym(5)$.
- Listing 3: The case $2.Alt(6)$ in characteristic 5.
- Listing 4: The case $2.2^4.5$ in characteristic 5.
- Listing 5: Groebner basis for I in characteristic 7.
- Listing 6: Groebner basis routine in characteristic not 7.
- Listing 7: Executing the Groebner basis search using the function findGroebnerBasis.
- Listing 8: Code for subgroups of Sp_6(q).
