# Generic Stabilizers for Actions of Algebraic Groups
## A resource for the computational search of generic stabilizers

Given the action of an algebraic group $G$ on a variety $Y$, one of the most fundamental ways to understand the action is to determine its generic behaviour, if it exists. Informally, there is a generic behaviour if there is an open dense subset of the variety where the action behaves the same on all elements.

More precisely, there is a generic stabilizer $S\leq G$ for the action of $G$ on $Y$, if there is a dense open subset $U$ of $Y$ such that for all $u\in U$ the stabilizer $G_u$ (the isotropy group of $u$) is $G$-conjugate to $S$.
