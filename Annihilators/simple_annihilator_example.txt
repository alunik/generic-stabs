/* 
Find the connected component of the generic stabilizer for
the action of B_4 on 1-spaces of its (half) spin module.

The following code computes the annihilator of a random 1-space in the spin module.
Since the dimension of the annihilator is 21, and this is the dimension of a dense stabilizer,
it must be the case that the 1-space is a generic one. We can then see that the Lie-algebra
annihilator is a B_3 subalgebra of B_4. Indeed B_3 is the generic stabilizer for this action.
